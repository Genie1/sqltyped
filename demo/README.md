Demo app
========

Demo app is a small REST server. Stack is:

* Unfiltered (REST API)
* json4s (JSON rendering)
* sqlÏ„yped (Database access)
* Slick (Database connection handling)
* MySQL (Database)

Note, current version compiles but does not boot :) I couldn't find Scala 2.10 compatible Unfiltered binaries anywhere. Please ping me if you know where can I find those.
